# MultiThreaded_Image_Filtering
Third Computer Assignment of Operating Systems course @ ECE, University of Tehran, Fall 2024

Implementation of both serial and parallel designs in C++ for applying various filters to an image.

# How to use:

Ensure you possess a BMP image file (e.g., image.bmp) in the same directory as the executable.

Execute the compiled program, named ImageFilters.out, with the input BMP image file specified as a command-line argument:

./ImageFilters.out image.bmp

The application will then apply a range of filters to the input image, creating an output BMP image named output.bmp.
